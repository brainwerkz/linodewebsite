			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
It seems as though every day you hear of another company having their computer systems breached. And that doesn't include systems affected by viruses or those companies who refuse to let such information become public knowledge for fear of causing a panic in the public and among their clients and customers. With such a threat from hackers and virus writers, no company or individual can afford NOT to take steps to prevent such intrusions.
			</p>

			<h3></h3>
			<p>
Disaster Recovery does not only mean events like fire, flood or hurricane. It also means systems affected by viruses, intrusion by hackers or just hardware that will eventually cease working. Studies show that 99% of all disaster is related to lost or damaged data and only 1% is due to catastrophic events. When a disaster does strike, most companies who fail to plan for disaster, over 50% fail to re-open their doors.BrainWerkz is experienced in planning for any disaster and can help determine and incorporate a Disaster Recovery plan custom tailored to your needs.
